# Tactical RP - Special Delivery

-------------------------------------------------

Special Delivery: A pack of 19 weapons extra weapons to complete the TacRP arsenal, ranging from conventional to absurd.

[h1]About TacRP[/h1]
TacRP is a weapon pack featuring weapons and animations from Tactical Intervention, an ill-fated Source shooter featuring animations from Minh "Gooseman" Le, the original animator for Counter-Strike.

With effort and passion, TacRP revived these weapons and animations and brought it to Garry's Mod, remaking its unique mechanics like blindfiring and quickthrowing in pursuit of tactical realism.

[h1]Ok, but what's so special about this new pack?[/h1]

TacRP InterOps was created by rigging third-party assets onto Tactical Intervention's animations.  While we got quite a lot of mileage out of this, it proved limiting in some areas.  Special Delivery leverages edited and entirely new animations to accomodate new types of weapons, such as additional bullpups and TacRP's first double-barrel shotgun!
